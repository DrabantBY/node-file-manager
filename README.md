# Manual:
`npm run start -- --username=your_username`

- `up` => _go upper from current directory_
- `cd path_to_directory` => _go to dedicated folder from current directory_
- `ls` => _print in console list of all files and folders in current directory_

!!! If you want to enter path names with spaces, you need to add an asterisk (*) symbol without any spaces. <br/>
(example: cp folder/file\*name.txt folder/target\*folder)
